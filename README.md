# AddonPacker
A simple addon to facilitate addon development for Blender

I did this small addon for myself so I can quickly test the code. 

I allows user to create a zip from a folder and import it in Blender in one click.

# How it Works:

You just select a folder where your addon are stored as folders, the addon will scan that folder and you will get a button for each folder. By clicking on a buttton with a folder name it will create a zip from that folder and import this zip as an addon in your Blender install.
